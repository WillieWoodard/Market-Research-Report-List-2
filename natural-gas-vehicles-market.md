<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG Vehicle</li><li>LNG Vehicle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural Gas Vehicles (NGVs) are categorized into two market types: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Vehicles and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Vehicles. CNG Vehicles use natural gas stored at high pressure (typically 3,000 to 3,600 psi) in specially designed fuel tanks. This gas is then delivered to the engine at a controlled pressure. On the other hand, LNG Vehicles use natural gas that has been cooled to its liquid state, allowing for greater energy density and increased storage capacity. Both CNG and LNG Vehicles offer cleaner emissions and cost advantages over traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles.</p></p>
