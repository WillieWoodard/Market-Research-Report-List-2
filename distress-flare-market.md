<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distress Flare Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Localisation System Type</li><li>Without Localisation System Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distress flare markets can be categorized into two types: those with a localization system and those without. Flares equipped with a localization system are designed to emit signals or activate GPS trackers, enabling rescuers to locate the distress signal accurately. On the other hand, flares without a localization system rely solely on their bright light and loud sound to attract attention. Both types serve the same purpose of alerting nearby individuals or authorities of an emergency situation, but flares with a localization system provide the added advantage of facilitating quicker and more precise rescue operations.</p></p>
