<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Cooler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber</li><li>Multiple Chamber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vacuum cooler market consists of two main types: single chamber and multiple chamber. In a single chamber vacuum cooler, only one product can be cooled at a time. This type is suitable for smaller-scale operations and offers single-point loading and unloading. On the other hand, multiple chamber vacuum coolers can cool multiple products simultaneously in different chambers. This type is more efficient and enables higher production volumes. Both types of vacuum coolers are used in various industries for fast and effective cooling of perishable goods.</p></p>
