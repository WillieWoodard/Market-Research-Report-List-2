<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fire Tube Boiler</li><li>Water Tube Boiler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine boilers are used on ships to generate steam for various applications. There are two main types: fire tube boilers and water tube boilers. Fire tube boilers have the hot gases from the combustion process flow through tubes surrounded by water, which transmits heat from the gases to the water. Water tube boilers, on the other hand, have water circulating through tubes while hot gases pass around them, heating the water indirectly. These different types cater to varying requirements and preferences in the marine industry.</p></p>
