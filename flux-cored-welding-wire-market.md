<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flux Cored Welding Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas-shielded</li><li>Self-shielded</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flux cored welding wire is available in two types: gas-shielded and self-shielded. Gas-shielded flux cored wires require the use of an external shielding gas, usually a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide, to protect the weld pool from atmospheric contamination. This type of wire offers better control over weld quality, higher deposition rates, and lower levels of spatter. On the other hand, self-shielded flux cored wires have a flux compound within the wire that generates a protective gas when heated. They are convenient for outdoor welding as they eliminate the need for external shielding gas. However, self-shielded wires typically produce more spatter and offer lower deposition rates compared to gas-shielded wires.</p></p>
