<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dosimeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TLD Dosimeters</li><li>OSL Dosimeters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dosimeters are devices used to measure an individual's exposure to ionizing radiation. TLD (Thermoluminescent Dosimeters) are a type of dosimeter that use crystals to record radiation exposure, which can be later analyzed in a laboratory. OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) dosimeters, on the other hand, utilize aluminum oxide to measure radiation, but can be read immediately with the help of a reader device. Both types of dosimeters play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of workers in industries involving radiation, such as healthcare and nuclear power plants.</p></p>
