<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LED Drive Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Power Supply</li><li>Built-In Power Supply</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The LED drive power market can be categorized into two main types: external power supply and built-in power supply. </p><p>In the external power supply market, the LED drive power is separate from the LED light fixture and is connected to it through an external power source. This allows for flexibility in installation and maintenance, as the power supply can be easily replaced or upgraded.</p><p>On the other hand, the built-in power supply market involves LED drive power that is integrated within the LED light fixture itself. This eliminates the need for a separate power supply unit, resulting in a more compact and streamlined design. Built-in power supplies also offer convenience and ease of use, requiring less wiring and ensuring a neater appearance.</p></p>
