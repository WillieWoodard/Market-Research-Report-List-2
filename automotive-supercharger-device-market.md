<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Supercharger Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Twin-screw Supercharger</li><li>Centrifugal Supercharges</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive supercharger device market is divided into two main types: twin-screw superchargers and centrifugal superchargers. Twin-screw superchargers use two interlocking screws to compress air and deliver it to the engine, providing immediate power boost and higher torque at low RPMs. On the other hand, centrifugal superchargers utilize a belt-driven impeller to force air into a compressor, resulting in increased power and higher RPM performance. Both types of superchargers enhance engine performance, but their mechanisms differ, providing drivers with varied benefits.</p></p>
