<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Convection Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Convection Heater</li><li>Forced Convection Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Convection heaters are commonly classified into two types: natural convection heaters and forced convection heaters. Natural convection heaters operate by creating warm air currents that rise naturally without the use of fans. These heaters are generally quieter and more energy-efficient. On the other hand, forced convection heaters utilize fans to circulate the heated air more quickly and uniformly throughout a space. These heaters are often preferred for larger areas or locations where a rapid heating response is desired. Both types of heaters are popular choices for providing warmth in homes and commercial settings.</p></p>
