<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Moisture Cured</li><li>Heat Cured</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Construction sealants are used to fill gaps and joints in construction projects, providing protection against moisture, air, and noise. There are two main types of construction sealants: moisture cured and heat cured. Moisture cured sealants harden when they come into contact with moisture in the air, making them suitable for humid environments. Heat cured sealants, on the other hand, require the application of heat to set and are commonly used in high-temperature environments. Both types offer durable and flexible sealing solutions for different construction requirements.</p></p>
