<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Axle Parts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full-Floating Axle Parts</li><li>Semi-Floating Axle Parts</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive axle parts market can be categorized into two types: full-floating axle parts and semi-floating axle parts. Full-floating axle parts refer to a design where the weight of the vehicle is supported by the axle housing rather than the axle shaft. In this system, the axle shaft is responsible solely for transmitting power to the wheels. On the other hand, semi-floating axle parts support both the weight of the vehicle and also transmit power to the wheels.</p></p>
