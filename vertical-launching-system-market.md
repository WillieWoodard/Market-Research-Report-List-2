<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Launching System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Launch</li><li>Cold Launch</li><li>Concentric Canister Launch</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Vertical Launching System (VLS) market consists of three types: hot launch, cold launch, and concentric canister launch. In hot launch, a missile is expelled from the launch tube using a gas generator, igniting the missile's propulsion system immediately. In cold launch, the missile is expelled from the launch tube by gas pressure, and its propulsion system is ignited after it clears the ship's structure. The concentric canister launch uses a canister with multiple compartments storing and launching individual missiles. These systems provide efficient and versatile methods to launch missiles from naval vessels.</p></p>
