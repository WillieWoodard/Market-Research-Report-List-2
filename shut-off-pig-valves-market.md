<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shut-Off Pig Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Pigging Valves</li><li>Automatic Pigging Valves</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The shut-off pig valves market includes two main types: manual pigging valves and automatic pigging valves. Manual pigging valves require physical intervention to open or close the valve, allowing the pig to pass through the pipeline. On the other hand, automatic pigging valves operate electronically or pneumatically, without human intervention. These valves are equipped with sensors or timers that trigger the opening and closing actions, making the pigging process more efficient and reducing the need for constant monitoring.</p></p>
