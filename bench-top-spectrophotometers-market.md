<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bench-Top Spectrophotometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-beam</li><li>Double-beam</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bench-top spectrophotometers are analytical instruments used to measure the intensity of light at different wavelengths. There are two main types in the market: single-beam and double-beam spectrophotometers. </p><p>Single-beam spectrophotometers use a single beam of light that passes through the sample and a reference cell. The intensity of the light is measured and compared between the sample and reference to determine the absorbance or transmittance of the sample. </p><p>Double-beam spectrophotometers use two separate beams of light, one passing through the sample and the other through a reference. The intensities of both beams are measured simultaneously, allowing for accurate comparisons and compensation for variations in light source or detector responses. </p><p>Both types have their advantages and are used in various applications, depending on the specific requirements of the analysis.</p></p>
