<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Padmount Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-type Padmount Transformers</li><li>Liquid-immersed Padmount Transformers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Padmount transformers are used to distribute electrical power in urban and suburban areas. There are two types of padmount transformers: dry-type and liquid-immersed. Dry-type padmount transformers use solid insulation, such as epoxy resin, to separate the windings and prevent the risk of fire. Liquid-immersed padmount transformers, on the other hand, use liquid insulation, typically mineral oil, to cool and insulate the windings. Both types provide a safe and reliable means of transforming and distributing electricity in outdoor locations.</p></p>
