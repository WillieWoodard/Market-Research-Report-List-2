<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Performance Butterfly Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wafer Type</li><li>Lug Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High performance butterfly valves are used to control the flow of fluids in various industrial applications. There are two main types: wafer type and lug type. Wafer type butterfly valves are lightweight and compact, and they are installed between flanges using bolts. They are mainly used in low-pressure applications. On the other hand, lug type butterfly valves have threaded inserts or bolts on both sides, enabling them to be installed without using flanges. This type of valve is preferred for applications that require a higher level of pressure resistance. Both types offer reliable performance and efficient flow control.</p></p>
