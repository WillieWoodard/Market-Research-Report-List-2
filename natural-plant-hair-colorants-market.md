<p><strong>The Natural Plant Hair Colorants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent Dyes</li><li>Semipermanent Dyes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The natural plant hair colorants market includes two main types of products: permanent dyes and semi-permanent dyes. Permanent dyes are designed to provide long-lasting color by penetrating the hair cuticle and depositing color molecules, resulting in a permanent change in hair color. On the other hand, semipermanent dyes do not penetrate the hair cuticle as deeply and only provide temporary color that gradually fades with washes. Both types of dyes are derived from natural plant sources and are considered a safer alternative to chemical-based hair colorants.</p></p>
