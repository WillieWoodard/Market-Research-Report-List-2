<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Molybdenum Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plane Target</li><li>Rotating Target</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The molybdenum target market consists of two primary types: plane targets and rotating targets. Plane targets are typically used in sputtering processes, where a high-energy plasma bombards the surface of the target, causing material to be ejected and deposited onto another surface. Plane targets are cost-effective and often used for large-scale production. Rotating targets, on the other hand, are utilized in magnetron sputtering, where the target rotates to ensure uniform erosion and deposition. These targets are commonly preferred for applications requiring high film quality and fine control over film thickness.</p></p>
