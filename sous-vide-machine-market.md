<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sous Vide Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immersion Types</li><li>Water Bath Types</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Sous vide machines come in two main types: immersion types and water bath types. Immersion types are compact devices that clip onto a pot or container, heating the water directly. They are portable and more affordable but have limited capacity. Water bath types consist of a self-contained unit with a built-in vessel, which provides constant temperature control. They offer larger capacity and are more precise but tend to be bulkier and pricier. Both types are used for sous vide cooking, a technique where vacuum-sealed food is cooked at low temperatures in water for extended periods to achieve perfect tenderness and taste.</p></p>
