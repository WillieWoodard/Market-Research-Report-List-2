<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open Loop Current Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isolated</li><li>Non-Isolated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Open Loop Current Sensor market consists of two types: Isolated and Non-Isolated. Isolated sensors provide electrical separation between the primary current being measured and the secondary output. This ensures safety and protection from high voltages. On the other hand, Non-Isolated sensors do not have this electrical separation, making them more cost-effective but less safe in high voltage applications. Both types serve the purpose of measuring current but differ in terms of safety features and price points.</p></p>
