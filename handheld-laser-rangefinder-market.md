<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Laser Rangefinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phase Method Rangefinder</li><li>Pulse Method Rangefinder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld laser rangefinder market consists of two main types: phase method rangefinders and pulse method rangefinders. Phase method rangefinders determine distance by measuring the change in phase of the laser beam, providing accurate results. On the other hand, pulse method rangefinders emit short laser pulses and measure the time it takes for the pulse to bounce back, calculating the distance based on the time and speed of light. Both types serve the purpose of accurately measuring distances but employ different methods to achieve this.</p></p>
