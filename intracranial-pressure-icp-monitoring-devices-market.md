<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive ICP Devices</li><li>Non-invasive ICP Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring devices are used to measure the pressure inside the skull. There are two main types of ICP monitoring devices: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive devices involve the insertion of a catheter through the skull to directly measure the pressure. This method provides more accurate readings but carries a higher risk of complications. Non-invasive devices, on the other hand, use external methods such as ultrasound or infrared technology to indirectly measure the pressure. While they are less accurate, non-invasive devices are safer and more comfortable for patients.</p></p>
